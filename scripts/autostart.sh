# ONE line per app. This is the file to edit when the daily set changes; the i3
# config just calls this once, with `exec` (not exec_always), so it runs at
# login and not again on every i3 restart.
#
# WHERE each app lands is mostly decided by the `assign` rules in
# ~/.config/i3/config, which key off WM_CLASS / instance / role, so opening one
# of those apps by hand later puts it in the same place as opening it at login.
#
# The TERMINAL and the FILE MANAGER are deliberately excluded from that. They
# are the two things you open constantly, and they should appear where you
# already are — so they have no assign rule, and are placed at login only: the
# terminal by the --role=main-term for_window rule, the file manager by
# place_once() below.
#
#   thunar                     -> workspace 1 AT LOGIN ONLY (place_once below)
#   xfce4-terminal             -> workspace 3 AT LOGIN ONLY, fullscreen
#                              (--role=main-term + a for_window rule)
#   brave-origin (default browser) -> workspace 5
#   AI Hub                     -> workspace 4
#   obsidian                   -> workspace 6
#   anki                       -> workspace 8, fullscreen
#   cliamp in a terminal       -> workspace 10   (via --role=cliamp)
#
# The stagger is not superstition: five apps racing for CPU and disk at login
# makes all five slow, and Anki and the browser are the two heavy ones. Nothing
# here depends on the order, so if you add an app just append a line.
